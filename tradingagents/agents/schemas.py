"""Pydantic schemas used by agents that produce structured output.

The framework's primary artifact is still prose: each agent's natural-language
reasoning is what users read in the saved markdown reports and what the
downstream agents read as context.  Structured output is layered onto the
three decision-making agents (Research Manager, Trader, Portfolio Manager)
so that:

- Their outputs follow consistent section headers across runs and providers
- Each provider's native structured-output mode is used (json_schema for
  OpenAI/xAI, response_schema for Gemini, tool-use for Anthropic)
- Schema field descriptions become the model's output instructions, freeing
  the prompt body to focus on context and the rating-scale guidance
- A render helper turns the parsed Pydantic instance back into the same
  markdown shape the rest of the system already consumes, so display,
  memory log, and saved reports keep working unchanged
